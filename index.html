        <h2>Things about HTML</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to create web pages.<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-html-a-beginners-guide/#:~:text=2.-,How%20does%20HTML%20work%3F,HTML%20elements%2C%20using%20HTML%20tags.">Working of HTML</a></li>
            <li>HTML is a markup language, which means it uses special codes (tags) to define the structure and content of a web page.</li>
            <li>HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs (opening and closing tags) to define the beginning and end of a perticular section of content</li>
            <li>HTML documents are structured using a hierarchy of tags, with the <html> tag at the top level, followed by the <head> and <body> tags, which define the document's metadata and content, respectively.</li>
            <li>HTML is a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-in/learning/serverless/glossary/client-side-vs-server-side/">Client Side</a> language, which means that it is interpreted by the user's web browser rather than on a server.</li>
            <li>HTML has undergone several revisions over the years, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5#:~:text=HTML5%20is%20a%20markup%20language,as%20the%20HTML%20Living%20Standard.">HTML5</a> being the current version and the most widely used.</li>
            <li>HTML can be used in conjunction with other web technologies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> (Cascading Style Sheets) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">JavaScript</a>, to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.</li>
            <li>HTML is an essential skill for anyone interested in web development, and there are many resources available online for learning HTML, including tutorials, courses, and reference guides.</li>
            <li>Finally, HTML is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being added all the time, so it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the language.</li>
